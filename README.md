Building a skeleton for an OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

## Create a PHP File Structure Worthy Of Reuse
In an attempt to better understand Object Oriented Programming with PHP. I am creating this for an easy to use php project I understand.

## File Structure
- index.php
    - includes
        - autoloader.inc.php
    - classes
        - person.class.php
- README.md

## To Use
The projects starts if you have a server capable of running php and point it towards the index.php file. I hope that it enough for you. I don't know what it really does yet.
